The Recochem "Renew Your Home for Spring" Contest is a micro-site (single page) that I developed based on mock-ups as a subcontractor for a web development firm that was experience work overflow.

Despite being a micro-site, I successfully made a case for using the Drupal platform as the Drupal webform module (or form API) is far easier to manage, tends to be more secure than hand-written forms and form processing code, and presents an easy way to manage form submissions. Why reinvent the wheel?

Essentially an exercise in creating a Drupal 6 custom theme from a mockup, the development was quite brief. The mockups were accurate, and the contract was completed within the week.
