Temple of Doom is an incomplete game prototype for the [Game Prototype Challenge, Version 4](http://gameprototypechallenge.com/v4) (GPCv4). The Game Prototype Challenge is a monthly, week-long, open challenge announced mainly through Twitter to developers to create a game prototype around two keywords or themes.[^1] The GPCv4 themes were burden and sunshine.

The initial (and unreleased) game design was a [3D tower building simulation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMK-MxFYGus) inspired by the Tower of Babel myth, developed in the Unity IDE. The design quickly became unwieldy and mathy for the short week-long timeframe, and the idea was largely abandoned.

The second attempt is the current prototype, a 2D tower-building simulation built using HTML5's canvas element and Javascript/jQuery. The project is hosted by Google Code in a SVN repository.
