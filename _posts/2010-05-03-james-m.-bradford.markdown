James Bradford asked for my assistance in completing his photography portfolio website. The working relationship was straight-forward and brief. He approached with the site mockup, content, and organization all prepared and wanted a developer to build the site. The site went live within a couple days of work.

The Drupal platform was selected as a CMS that could organize images into series and provide an administrative interface to allow the addition of additional photos in the future. The custom Drupal 6 theme reflects the mockup, the site implements lightbox for viewing photos, and it dynamically caches photo thumbnails. The website is also being hosted on my server on a LAMP stack.
