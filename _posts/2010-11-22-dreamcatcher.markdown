This was a whimsical first attempt at a game prototype. As part of the first #GamePrototypeChallenge with the objective to prototype a game with the themes: collectibles and dreams, Dreamcatcher was developed.

The game features a Human vs. AI competition to collect dreams the fastest while preventing the other from winning, programmed entirely in the Unity game IDE. The game resides on a website where visitors can play it through Unity's web player. The website is a simple Drupal one-page micro-site that uses Markdown text internally to manage the copytext.
