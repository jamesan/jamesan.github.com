James An began his foray into web development in May 2008, with the development of OpenMynds.com, released in the subsequent month. His web development work has often focused on non-profit organizations and community groups. (Writing about yourself in third-person seems a bit odd, but I suppose that's how autobios are written. Anyway, onward!)
