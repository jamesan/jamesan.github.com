Since 2005, Drupal has been a participating organization of the Google Summer of Code (GSoC), "a global program that offers student developers stipends to write code for various open source software projects. Through Google Summer of Code, accepted student applicants are paired with a mentor or mentors from the participating projects, thus gaining exposure to real-world software development scenarios and the opportunity for employment in areas related to their academic pursuits". [^1] As part of the program, student developers are hired by Google to work for the various participating organizations (e.g. Drupal).

The Drupal Social Network Framework (DSNF) was a proposal I put forward to the Drupal community in 2009 for Drupal 6 to examine and assist how existing contributed modules work together in a social network context. The project included a research and report phase as well as a coding phase, to create an installation profile specifically for social network websites using Drupal.

The [resulting install profile](http://drupal.org/project/dsnf_install) has since not kept up with Drupal releases since the completion of the project in August 2009.
